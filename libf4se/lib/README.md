# FFI

This is FFI directory.  In previous attempts, bindgen was used, that's why we have 'wrappers' here.

Currently, all FFI bindings written by hands. Use this directory to download F4SE source code and analyze it.

## Usage

1. On Linux, edit the 'install.sh', you need F4SE_VERSION variable
2. Run 'install.sh', it will download two f4se repositories

## Status
In most cases, you not need to do something here. Only in case of writing new bindings or exploring source code of F4SE.
